#Carpool

###High Level Goals
* Connecting college students who can drive with ones that need rides.

* If they have a similar location they want to go to and a time, then a direct message is set up between them.

* Page of listings, where people schedule when and where they are going or want to go, and others can scroll through to see potentional options

* Notifications to remind people of set plans, messages, or new connections

* Accounts for messaging and connecting (vassar login)

###Constraints
* Vassar Account Login*
* Google or Apple Maps

###Business Case
Many students do not have access to cars, and unfortunately the public transportation in the area isn't great. Luckily, lots of people want to go to the same place. This app connects drivers and passengers on campus who want to go to the similar places at similar times. It limits needless spending on uber and car emissions, and connects students!
