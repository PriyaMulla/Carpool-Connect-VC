* Passenger or driver can search Listings Page, if they have a similar location they want to go to and a time, then the app shares their contact info so they can message.
* Scheduled Trips Page, where once Passenger and Driver agree on plan, they Schedule a Trip, with specified pick up and drop off location and time.

* Notifications of potential trips, planned trips, and messages*

###Constraints

###Business Case
Many students do not have access to cars, and unfortunately the public transportation in the area isn't great. Luckily, lots of people want to go to the same place. This app connects drivers and passengers on campus who want to go to the similar places at similar times. It limits needless spending on uber and car emissions, and connects students!
