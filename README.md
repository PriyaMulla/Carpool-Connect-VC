# Carpool App

App (for Vassar students at the moment) that allows them to create listings of places they want to go/ are going. 
Listings contain role (driver or passenger), time and date of trip, pick up and drop off location and contact info. 
These are then added to a dashboard that everyone has access to. A user can filter this dashboard of listings based on the date,
start location, end location, seats available, and/ or role. While scrolling through a user can click on a listing and be taken
to a more detailed display of the listing. (this app isn't published yet)
