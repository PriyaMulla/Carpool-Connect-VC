In this prototype a user is able to create an account and a listing. At the moment, there can only be one user and one listing, but that listing does get saved to an array. The account takes in a username, password, email, and name–all which have simplified restrictions. For example, password requires an upper case letter at the beginning, a special character, and to be longer than 5 characters. Listings take in a time, date, start and end location, how many seats, and if you’re the driver or passenger. The time, date only accept a specific type of int and start and end location accept any type of (non-empty) string for now.

To run the prototype enter the View class and run its main() method. Then the program will give instructions on how to create an account and listing.
